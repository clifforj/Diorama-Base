Diorama-Base
============

A CSS base for building 3D dioramas. This only works for Chrome and Safari at the moment. (had some issues getting it to work with Firefox :( )

[There's an example minecraft one here](https://clifforj.github.io/diorama/)

[The LESS for the above contains usage examples](https://github.com/clifforj/clifforj.github.io/blob/master/diorama/less/minecraft-diorama.less)
